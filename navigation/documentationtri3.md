Hello! This is the documentation for Tri 3. <br>
Throughout this trimester I have worked on multipule things, for example: <br>
 - Two Player System <br>
 - APIs Including API adaption and API creation <br>
 - Lead Documenter - very ironic considering that I am not using tailwind for this documentation. <br>
 - Experimentation <br>
 - Developing our Platformer Game Engine <br>

I have also included many other things that were not explicitly mentioned, however were done last trimester. Examples include: <br>
 - N@tM Feedback <br>
 - Reflections and Next Steps <br>
 - Tinkers (kinda...) <br>

# Two Player System: <br>
 - For our two player system, I modified the `Player.js` file to allow for two players to control the same character. 
 - I modified the `GameLevelEnd.js` file to allow for two players to control the same character. <br>
### Example Code: <br>
```javascript
keypress: { up: 87, left: 65, down: 83, right: 68 }
```
<br>
 - The following code was for setting the keys to move the player within the file `GameLevelEnd.js` <br>
 - I also modified the `Player.js` file to allow for two characters within one file. <br>

# APIs: <br>
 - During our APIs time period, I primarily focused on creating the notebooks.<br>
 - While developing the notebooks, I also worked on hack assignments and homework.<br>
 - For the homework assignment involving a currency conversion API, I created an answer key.<br>
 - We taught local storage alongside APIs.<br>
 - I implemented a local storage section in both the answer key and the homework.<br>
### Example Code:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem("key", "value");
```
<br>
 - The above code was for setting a key to a value within the file <br>

# Documentation: <br>
 - I created this documentation for notebooks we did for our teaching <br>
 - Me and Nikhil were responsible for creating documetation, he created the documetation for what we did and I made documentation for notebooks. <br>
 - Since I was in charge of notebook documentation I did a unique take on tailwind and for our frontmatter I made a review exercise intead of a infographic

# Experimentaiton: <br>
 - Me and Evan worked on a experiment where we created a game that was similar to the hacks that were assigned on monday <br>
 - We created a platformer game with a health system. <br>
 - We are also planning on modifying the code for the hacks assigned on monday <br>

# Platformer Game Engine: <br>
 - Our platformer game engine was mostly developed by me and Evan. <br>
 - This engine was comprised of a new subdirectory within the adventureGame file known as adPlatEngine. <br>
 - Within this subdirectory me and evan have created a html file which serves as the page you go to in order to access the platformer <br>
 - This subdirectory includes an entire new engine and game systems. <br>
 - This one subdirectory singlehandly contained 90% of our efforts throughout the trimester, and was overall just a pain to create, however with the results that we have gotten yesterday at N@tM it was entirely worth it. <br>
