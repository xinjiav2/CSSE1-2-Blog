Hello! This is the documentation for Tri 3. <br>
Throughout this trimester I have worked on multipule things, for example: <br>
 - Two Player System <br>
 - APIs Including API adaption and API creation <br>
 - Lead Documenter - very ironic considering that I am not using tailwind for this documentation. <br>
 - Experimentation <br>
 - Developing our Platformer Game Engine <br>
 - Developing our own custom enemy system <br>

I have also included many other things that were not explicitly mentioned, however were done last trimester. Examples include: <br>
 - N@tM Feedback <br>
 - Reflections and Next Steps <br>
 - Tinkers (kinda...) <br>

# Two Player System: <br>
 - For our two player system, I modified the `Player.js` file to allow for two players to control the same character. 
 - I modified the `GameLevelEnd.js` file to allow for two players to control the same character. <br>
### Example Code: <br>
```javascript
keypress: { up: 87, left: 65, down: 83, right: 68 }
```
<br>
 - The following code was for setting the keys to move the player within the file `GameLevelEnd.js` <br>
 - I also modified the `Player.js` file to allow for two characters within one file. <br>

# APIs: <br>
 - During our APIs time period, I primarily focused on creating the notebooks.<br>
 - While developing the notebooks, I also worked on hack assignments and homework.<br>
 - For the homework assignment involving a currency conversion API, I created an answer key.<br>
 - We taught local storage alongside APIs.<br>
 - I implemented a local storage section in both the answer key and the homework.<br>
### Example Code:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem("key", "value");
```
<br>
 - The above code was for setting a key to a value within the file <br>

# Documentation: <br>
 - I created this documentation for notebooks we did for our teaching <br>
 - Me and Nikhil were responsible for creating documetation, he created the documetation for what we did and I made documentation for notebooks. <br>
 - Since I was in charge of notebook documentation I did a unique take on tailwind and for our frontmatter I made a review exercise intead of a infographic

# Experimentaiton: <br>
 - Me and Evan worked on a experiment where we created a game that was similar to the hacks that were assigned on monday <br>
 - We created a platformer game with a health system. <br>
 - We are also planning on modifying the code for the hacks assigned on monday <br>

# Platformer Game Engine: <br>
 - Our platformer game engine was mostly developed by me and Evan. <br>
 - This engine was comprised of a new subdirectory within the adventureGame file known as adPlatEngine. <br>
 - Within this subdirectory me and evan have created a html file which serves as the page you go to in order to access the platformer <br>
 - This subdirectory includes an entire new engine and game systems. <br>
 - This one subdirectory singlehandly contained 90% of our efforts throughout the trimester, and was overall just a pain to create, however with the results that we have gotten yesterday at N@tM it was entirely worth it. <br>

# Enemy System: <br>
 - I know, this is very repetitive. <br>
 - I believe we had 5 different enemy lessons, however ours were very unique. <br>
 - Our enemy was very different than any other enemy we had a lesson on due to our enemy not following a set path, and instead tracking the player. <br>
 - We mostly used the distance formula to track the nearest player and draw a line to them, the enemy will follow that line. <br>

# Other Things Not Explicitly Mentioned However Were Done Last Trimester: <br>

# N@tM Feedback: <br>
 - This time, for N@tM, we had a really good game to show off, and it was not overshadowed by Evan and West's game. Well technically it is but now its both mine and Evan's game (as well as everyone else that worked on it in our group.) <br>
 - Instead of Srijan Atti, I got advice from a freshman, that was more blunt about what we should have done and what we shouldnt. <br>
 - We asked Preston Poon, and he gave us some advice that were actually similar to what Srijan said last trimester. <br>
 - Unfortunetly, he didn't praise us as much as Srijan did. Preston mostly focused on the technical aspects, such as how there ISIN'T A INSTRUCTIONS PAGE, WHICH WAS SOMETHING SRIJAN TOLD US TO ADD ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ I'M SELLING. <br>
 - Preston also told us that he didn't find the jump system very smooth, part of our platformer. This is something that we took importance in, as we didn't use Mort's so we couldn't blame someone else. <br>
 - He gave us another aspect to take into consideration, such as "maybe more platformer levels or make it more difficult the more pearls you collect" <br>

# Tinkers! (or really, just 5 key things we learned): <br>
 - I do not really know why I put this here as I already explained what I did, which was basically my tinkers, such as our game engine? tinker. Our enemy? tinker.<br>
 - So I instead focused on what we learned!<br>
 - My first Key Thing (Following the format of last trimesters) is my github commits. <br>
 - Last trimester I ended with 376 commits, and this trimester I had... <br>
 ![very alt texting](comit2.png)
 - 596. This includes the one from last trimester, so I definetly did a little less, however now my commits were much bigger. <br>
 - Item 2! <br>
 - Last trimester we learned how to use github, and just the basics. This trimester we learned how to apply the github skills we used to do great things. Well great things being making around a pr to portfolio_2025/pages... <br>
 - We learned to apply our github skills, to make organizations, as well as to make a very pretty color board full of our schedule :D <br>
